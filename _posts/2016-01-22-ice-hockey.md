For any request concerning our Sport Consulting and Management Services please feel free to contact us:

SinCOM Sport Consulting

SinCOM Sport Management is a human sized sports company which is 
active especially in Europe and has contacts to all the major European 
leagues such as Russia, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and of
course Switzerland. All these countries are covered by a network of 
high qualified individuals who's goals are to represent the best 
interests of the players.

At SinCOM Sport Management we know the needs of a player and we know the game.

Our company is oriented and adapted to all the changes of the actual and future ice hockey.

We work free of bureaucracy workload and we don't financially 
overcharge our players just to finance a fancy and totally useless 
infrastructure.

We will always negotiate the best contracts for the players 
independently from the league or the country and we have the best 
support anywhere in the world.
